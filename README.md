JS Recon allows you to instantly fetch, perfectly beautify, and aggressively parse any minified JavaScript file to extract **over 40+ bug bounty hunting categories** directly in your browser. Since it operates entirely client-side, your targets and code are never logged to an external backend server.

---

## Features
- **Instant Beautification**: Uses optimized `js-beautify` configurations to instantly expand compressed code into highly readable, line-by-line developer formatting without breaking strings or logic.
- **Cross-Origin Fetching**: Bypasses restrictive CORS policies to pull target `.js` files using proxy routing.
- **Deep Extraction Engine**: Accurately parses minified/obfuscated code to discover:
  - **Domains & IPs**: Base hostnames, internal IPv4 subnets, localhost references.
  - **Attack Surface**: Full URLs, API Endpoints, versioned routes (`/v1/`, `/v2/`), GraphQL definitions, Webhooks, Websockets.
  - **Secrets & Keys**: Automatically flags API Keys, JWTs, Bearer tokens, AWS `AKIA` keys, and raw Private Keys.
  - **Cloud Infra**: S3 buckets, Firebase databases, CloudFront CDNs.
  - **Parameters & Roles**: Hidden `?debug=` and `?admin=` logic, local `isAdmin=true` assignments.
- **Interactive UI**: Click any extracted item in the dynamic sidebar to instantly scroll to and highlight its exact declaration in the main code editor.
- **Vibrant Theming**: Built with a sleek, premium dark-mode GitHub style layout and categorized, color-coded extraction tables.
